// Prompt:
/*
Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.
*/

// notes
/*
Thoughts on how to proceed:
1. keep a log of all the values as I go through the BST
2. keep track of smallest difference using Math.min()
*/
